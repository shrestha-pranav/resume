# HackMobile, Qualcomm

I first participated in HackMobile in 2017. We developed a recipe suggestion smartphone app that used a pre-trained neural network to identify food in your refrigerator.

In June 2018, we participated in HackMobile for the second time. This time, we developed an ultra-low cost, low-power, line-of-sight data transfer system using visible light (essentially, a data transfer system using visible light instead of bluetooth or radio-frequency). We managed to achieve top 10 in the first round, becoming a finalist. Unfortunately, we were eliminated in the voting stage of the competition.

The third time was the charm in June 2019. Our team combined Bose's AR glasses and Azure speech SDK to develop a low-latency speech-to-speech translation system. The final product was gesture-enabled sunglasses that automagically translated foreign speech into a language of your choice. We won Judge's Favorite in the first round, passed the voting round with a large margin and were selected as the top team in the Shark Tank style pitch stage by top Qualcomm execs.


# Artificial Intelligence TA

Over Spring 2019 and Summer 2019, I was a teaching assistant for Prof Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi for the course COMS 4701 Artificial Intelligence at Columbia.

It was a well-established course - so, on one hand, course materials were quite streamlined but on the other, assignment specifications, starter code and grading scripts had become quite outdated. The first thing I advocated for involved completely migrating the course to Python 3. Python 2 was nearing end-of-life. With agreement, I rewrote and streamlined skeleton code for all legacy assignments. Besides, I also designed the specifications, started code and grading script for a completely new assignment as a simple introduction to Keras. 

Besides design and migration to Python 3, I also actively tried to improve responsiveness throughout the course logistics. The average Piazza response time improved to 19 minutes in Summer 2019.
